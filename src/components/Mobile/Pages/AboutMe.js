          <p>
            Having developed my professional skills in customer experience roles
            and the hospitality industry for the past decade, I've reached a
            point where I'm ready for my next big adventure.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's when I stumbled upon my passion for coding. It has naturally
            become something I look forward to every day. I relish the feeling
            of accomplishment when I crack a piece of code and get to flex my
            creative thinking skills. This newfound passion led me to enrol in a
            software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I thrive on creating delightful designs, solving complex problems,
            and making a positive impact. From crafting fun and beautiful user
            experiences to tackling intricate challenges. I find immense
            fulfilment in using my skills to bring joy and drive meaningful
            change.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a natural explorer, always eager to dive into new experiencesâ€”
            whether it's exploring different cuisines, discovering uncharted
            travel destinations, pursuing diverse hobbies, or adopting
            innovative work methodologies. I've had the pleasure of living and
            working in the UK, and I'm open to exciting work opportunities
            across Australia and Europe. Drawing inspiration from others, I'm
            keen to collaborate with a supportive and open-minded team.
